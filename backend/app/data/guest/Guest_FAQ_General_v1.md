## In-room Controls – Lights, Air Conditioning & Heating

### “I can’t find the switch for the bed lamp.”

- Many bedside lamps are controlled by:
  - A small switch on the lamp base or cord, **or**
  - A wall switch near the bed.
- Try:
  1. Checking the lamp base and cord.
  2. Trying the switches closest to the bed.
- If you still cannot find it, call Reception and we will assist or send someone to show you.

### “The air conditioning doesn’t seem to be working. How do I use it?”

- Most rooms use a **wall-mounted controller** or **panel near the entry**.
- General steps:
  1. Press the **Power** button to turn the system on.
  2. Choose **Cool** or **Heat** mode (often shown as a snowflake or sun icon).
  3. Set your desired temperature (e.g. 21–23°C).
  4. Adjust fan speed if available.

- Please note:
  - It can take several minutes for the room to noticeably cool or warm.
  - If doors or windows are open, the system may be less effective.

If the display is blank, flashing, or you are unsure, please contact Reception so we can check or send Maintenance.

### “The heater is not heating fast enough.”

- In cooler Tasmanian weather, rooms can take some time to warm up.
- Close windows and curtains to help keep heat in.
- Ensure the system is set to **Heat** mode and the temperature is above current room temperature.

If no warm air is coming out after 10–15 minutes, please contact Reception.

### “The TV is not working.”

- Check that:
  1. The TV is plugged in and switched on at the wall.
  2. The correct input/source is selected (often “TV” or “HDMI 1”).
  3. The remote has working batteries.

If the screen stays black, shows “No signal”, or the sound is missing, call Reception – we can usually fix this quickly or provide a replacement remote.
